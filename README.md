# Physics based animation
 Physics based animation course projects

# Overview

These are the course projects implemented by C# in the Unity engine. **The simulations are all done by C# script** without using build-in physics engine of Unity. 



The projects contains simulations for 

- Rigid body simulation with collision detection and response using impulse method and simulation with shape matching
- Cloth simulation with implicit integration and Position based dynamics(PBD)
- Elastic body simulation with Finite Volume Method(FVM)
- Fluid simulation with Shallow wave equation
